Title = Tail Assignment Optimization – Problem Description

[Subsection 1.1]
Title = Basic Tail Assignment Problem
Description = The tails assignment problem deals with assignment of flight schedules (flight legs) to individual aircraft tails. The flights should be assigned taking into consideration the constraints specified and should produce a schedule which assigns all scheduled flights.

[Entities]
Aircrafts = 
    - Aircraft Registration: Unique Identifier for Aircraft
    - Aircraft Type: Specifies the aircraft family
    - Seating capacity: Different aircrafts can have different capacity depending on how the airline configures it

Flights = 
    - Flight Identifier: An Alpha numeric code used to identify a flight
    - Flight Date: Date on which the flight is planned to be operated
    - Departure Station: The airport at which the aircraft operating the flight is scheduled to depart
    - Scheduled Time of Departure: The departure time of the flight
    - Arrival Station: The airport at which the flight is scheduled to arrive
    - Scheduled Time of Arrival: The arrival time of the flight
    - Aircraft Type: The type of the aircraft on which the flight should operate
    - Physical Seating capacity: The seating capacity which is required on the aircraft
    - Minimum Ground Time: The minimum time the aircraft should be available at the departure station before the flight’s departure
    - Onward Flight Information: The next flight which should be operated by aircraft as per original schedule from planning department

[Assignment Logic]
Description = The basic tail assignment logic is to assign the flights to a matching aircraft. The aircraft is matched using the following information:
    - Aircraft Subtype: The Subtype planned for the flight should match the subtype of the aircraft
    - Seating information: The next level of matching is using seating configuration. The system shall need to filter down the aircrafts that matches with the seating configuration within the subtype.
    - Pre-assignments: Ensure no pre-assignments (e.g., maintenance events) are being violated.

[General Features]
1. The system shall allow users to select the aircraft subtype for which assignment needs to be done.
2. The system shall allow the users to specify the period for which assignment needs to be done.
3. The system shall allow the users to specify if the pre-assignments need to be respected.
4. The system shall allow users to specify if certain aircrafts within the selected subtype do not need to be used in the allocation.
5. The system shall allow users to specify if the trip needs to be maintained in the same aircraft or can be broken.
