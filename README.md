## Project Details

### Overview
Aero is a software that aims to improve the efficiency of airlines by providing a solution to the tail assignment problem. It uses multiple programming paradigms to optimize the assignment of aircraft to flights, ensuring that the aircraft are utilized to their full potential and thus reducing costs for the airline.

### Problem Statement
The tail assignment problem involves assigning flight schedules to individual aircraft while considering various constraints. The goal is to create an optimized schedule that ensures all flights are assigned appropriately, taking into account factors such as aircraft type, seating capacity, and pre-assigned maintenance events.


### Solution
Our solution leverages advanced algorithms to tackle the tail assignment problem in airlines. By optimizing aircraft assignments to flight schedules, we ensure efficient utilization of resources, reducing operational costs. The software considers various constraints such as aircraft type, seating capacity, and maintenance schedules to generate an optimal flight schedule. This results in improved efficiency and cost savings for airlines.
